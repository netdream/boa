To enable Apache Solr Search feature for any site on your BOA server, please
download and enable either Apache Solr Search Integration module with required
third party library, as explained in its readme, or download and enable
Search API Solr search module (D7 only).

https://drupal.org/project/apachesolr (6.x-1.7 or newer)
https://drupal.org/project/search_api_solr (7.x-1.0-rc3 or newer)

BOA system supports both Apache Solr Search Integration module and Search API
Solr search module (used by default), and you have a few options to use it with
different versions of Apache Solr and Jetty server, for maximum backward and
future compatibility.

By default, all pre-configured Solr Cores come with required solrconfig.xml,
schema.xml and protwords.txt files compatible with Solr 4.x config series from
Search API Solr search module for Solr 4.x, or Solr 1.x config
series for Solr 1.x

You may want to replace them if you wish to use Solr with Drupal 6 sites,
which require Apache Solr Search Integration module instead.

You should configure each core separately to use correct version by uploading
respective solrconfig.xml, schema.xml and protwords.txt files to the
solr{1,3,4}/core*/conf directory and restarting correct Jetty instance with
command `service jetty{7,8,9} restart`.

NOTE: If your site was already configured to use any of those modules, you must
      delete its search index (not just rebuild it) or the site and the search
      indexing will fail to work properly.

In your Solr configuration there are ready to use 10 separate cores, since you
need to use one core per site to avoid displaying search results from different
sites on any site with enabled Solr module.

The access credentials you should use are as follows:

Solr host ........: 127.0.0.1

Solr port ........: 8077 (for Solr 1.x with Jetty 7)
Solr port ........: 8088 (for Solr 3.x with Jetty 8)
Solr port ........: 8099 (for Solr 4.x with Jetty 8 or 9 on Precise/Wheezy)
Solr port ........: 8080 (for Solr 1.x with Jetty 7 migrated from Tomcat)

Solr path ........: solr/core0 (configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core1 (configured in solr.xml)

Solr path ........: solr/core2 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core3 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core4 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core5 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core6 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core7 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core8 (not configured in solr.xml)
Solr path ........: solr/core9 (not configured in solr.xml)

To add more cores, you need to:

1. Create a copy of example core directory:
   cp -ar /opt/solr3/core0 /opt/solr3/core11

2. Add this new core in the solr.xml file:
   /opt/solr1/solr.xml (for Solr 1.x with Jetty 7)
   /opt/solr3/solr.xml (for Solr 3.x with Jetty 8)
   /opt/solr4/solr.xml (for Solr 4.x with Jetty 8 or 9 on Precise/Wheezy)

3. Restart correct Jetty instance:
   service jetty7 restart (for Solr 1.x with Jetty 7)
   service jetty8 restart (for Solr 3.x with Jetty 8)
   service jetty9 restart (for Solr 4.x with Jetty 8 or 9 on Precise/Wheezy)

You can also rename the "core name" in the file:
  /opt/solr{1,3,4}/solr.xml
to avoid using them by not authorized sites owners:

  <cores adminPath="/admin/cores">
    <core name="325o45758" instanceDir="core0" />
    <core name="w44337377" instanceDir="core1" />
  </cores>

To install one or more supported versions of Apache Solr with corresponding
Jetty version, just add correct keyword to the _XTRAS_LIST in the system
configuration /root/.barracuda.cnf file.

SR1 (for Solr 1.x with Jetty 7)
SR3 (for Solr 3.x with Jetty 8)
SR4 (for Solr 4.x with Jetty 8 or 9 on Precise/Wheezy)

It is even possible to add them *all* on upgrade when you are already running
now deprecated Tomcat 6 with Solr 1.x, because new, Jetty based Solr instances
use separate ports and directories.

TOMCAT TO JETTY MIGRATION NOTE:

To migrate existing Solr cores from Tomcat 6 to Jetty 7, add special variable
_TOMCAT_TO_JETTY=YES in your config file /root/.barracuda.cnf and run
barracuda up-{stable,head} upgrade.

It will migrate all cores as-is, so they will be available on the same port 8080
previously used by Tomcat. It will also automatically install Jetty 7 with
Solr 1.4.1 for you, even if you forgot to add required SR1 in the _XTRAS_LIST.

This migration is forced since BOA-2.4.0, because we don't support Tomcat
for a very long time already, so it shouldn't be used with BOA.


NOTE ON RELATED ERRORS:

 "Apache Solr Attachments Java executable not found
  Could not execute a java command. You may need to set the path of
  the correct java executable as the variable 'apachesolr_attachments_java'
  in settings.php."

To fix add in the site's local.settings.php file this line:

  $conf['apachesolr_attachments_java'] = '/usr/bin/java7 -Xms32m -Xmx64m';
